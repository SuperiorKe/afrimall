## 📋 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure

- **PaymentIntent API** (`/api/stripe/create-payment-intent`)
- **Webhook Handler** (`/api/stripe/webhook`) for payment confirmations
- **Orders API** (`/api/orders`) for order creation and retrieval
- **Environment Configuration** with proper TypeScript types

### ✅ Frontend Components

- **Error Handling** throughout the payment flow

### ✅ Security Features
- **PCI Compliance** - Card data never touches your servers

- **Environment Variables** - API keys properly secured

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Stripe Keys
1. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. For testing, use the test keys (they start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 3. Set Up Webhooks
1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add a new endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select these events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.requires_action`
   - `charge.dispute.created`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 4. Test the Integration

#### Test Cards (Use in Development)
```
Visa: 4242424242424242

## 📱 Mobile Money (Future Enhancement)

The foundation is set to add mobile money payments later:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Stripe not loaded"**
   - Check your publishable key is set correctly
   - Ensure internet connection for Stripe.js

2. **"Payment failed"**
   - Check webhook endpoint is accessible
   - Verify webhook secret is correct

3. **"Order not created"**
   - Check server logs for API errors
   - Ensure database connection is working

### Development Tips:

- Use Stripe's test mode for development
- Check the Stripe Dashboard for payment logs
- Monitor webhook events in Stripe Dashboard
- Use browser dev tools to debug client-side issues

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Before going live:

1. **Switch to live keys** (remove `test_` from keys)
2. **Update webhook endpoint** to production URL
3. **Test with real cards** (small amounts)
4. **Monitor Stripe Dashboard** for any issues
5. **Set up email notifications** for failed payments
