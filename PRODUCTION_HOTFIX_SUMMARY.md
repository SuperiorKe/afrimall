# üö® Production Hotfix Summary

## **Date:** December 2024
## **Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment

---

## **üîç Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: PostgreSQL Error 42703 - Undefined Column**
**Error:** `column "_verified" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** 
- `_verified` field doesn't exist in the Customers collection schema
- Field was added in development but not in production database

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `_verified: true` from customer creation in `src/app/api/customers/route.ts`
- Added comment explaining why field was removed

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ Customers can now be created successfully
- ‚úÖ No database schema changes required
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with production

---

### **Issue 2: ProductSnapshot Image Validation**
**Error:** Order creation failed due to image field validation

**Root Cause:**
- `productSnapshot.image` field changed from `upload` (relationship) to `text` (URL)
- Production database might still expect relationship
- Missing or invalid image URLs caused validation errors

**Fix Applied:**
1. Made `image` field optional in `src/collections/Orders.ts`
   - Added `required: false`
   - Updated admin description

2. Updated order creation logic in `src/app/(frontend)/checkout/_components/steps/OrderReview.tsx`
   - Conditionally includes image only if URL exists and is valid
   - Uses spread operator to omit field when not available

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Orders can be created with or without product images
- ‚úÖ No validation errors for missing images
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of edge cases
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible

---

## **üìù Files Modified**

### **1. src/app/api/customers/route.ts**
**Change:** Removed `_verified: true` field
```diff
- _verified: true, // Skip email verification for checkout customers
+ // Note: _verified field removed - doesn't exist in schema
```

### **2. src/collections/Orders.ts**
**Change:** Made image field optional
```diff
  {
    name: 'image',
    type: 'text',
+   required: false,
    admin: {
-     description: 'Product image URL at time of order',
+     description: 'Product image URL at time of order (optional)',
    },
  },
```

### **3. src/app/(frontend)/checkout/_components/steps/OrderReview.tsx**
**Change:** Conditional image inclusion
```diff
  productSnapshot: {
    title: item.product.title,
    sku: item.product.sku || item.product.id,
-   image: item.product.images[0]?.url || null,
+   // Only include image if it exists and is a valid string
+   ...(item.product.images?.[0]?.url && typeof item.product.images[0].url === 'string'
+     ? { image: item.product.images[0].url }
+     : {}),
  },
```

## **üöÄ Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Commit Changes**

```bash
# Commit 1: Critical hotfix
git add src/app/api/customers/route.ts
git commit -m "hotfix: remove _verified field causing production errors

```

### **Step 2: Push to Production**

```bash
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Monitor Deployment**

Watch for:
- Build completion
- No deployment errors
- Application starts successfully
- Database connections working

### **Step 4: Post-Deployment Testing**

1. **Test Customer Creation:**
   - Go to checkout
   - Enter contact information
   - Verify customer is created (check console)

2. **Test Order Creation:**

## **üîÑ Rollback Plan**

If issues persist after deployment:

### **Quick Rollback**
```bash
git revert HEAD~3
git push origin main --force
```

### **Database Rollback**
No database migrations were run, so no rollback needed.

---

## **üìä Expected Outcomes**

### **Before Hotfix:**
- ‚ùå PostgreSQL error 42703 on customer creation
- ‚ùå Order validation errors for image field
- ‚ùå Checkout flow broken
- ‚ùå No orders could be created

### **After Hotfix:**
- ‚úÖ Customer creation succeeds
- ‚úÖ Order creation succeeds
- ‚úÖ Images handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ Complete checkout flow works
- ‚úÖ Production compatible
- ‚úÖ No database errors

---

## **üéØ Success Metrics**

Monitor these after deployment:
- **Customer Creation Success Rate:** Should be 100%
- **Order Creation Success Rate:** Should be 100%
- **Database Errors:** Should be 0
- **Checkout Completion Rate:** Should increase
- **Payment Success Rate:** Should improve

---

## **üìû Support**

If issues occur:
1. Check production error logs
2. Review database query logs
3. Test checkout flow manually
4. Check Stripe dashboard for payment errors
5. Review application logs for details

- Existing orders unaffected
- Existing customers unaffected

### **Future Improvements**
- Consider adding proper database migrations
- Implement email verification flow
- Add image upload validation
- Create admin notification system
