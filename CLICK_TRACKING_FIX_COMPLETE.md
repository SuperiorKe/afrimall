# ✅ SendGrid Click Tracking Issue - FIXED

## 🔍 The Problem

When clicking the password reset link in the email, you were redirected to:
```
https://url5873.afrimall.app/ls/click?upn=...
```

This caused:
- ❌ SSL certificate error ("Your connection is not private")
- ❌ Wrong domain (SendGrid tracking domain instead of your app)
- ❌ Security concerns (third-party tracking on sensitive links)

**Root Cause:** SendGrid's click tracking was enabled, wrapping all links with their tracking domain.

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **1. Disabled Click Tracking for Password Reset Emails**

Updated `src/lib/email/email.ts` to disable SendGrid's click tracking:

```typescript
const mailOptions = {
  from: this.config!.from,
  to: data.email,
  subject: 'Reset Your AfriMall Password',
  text: this.generatePasswordResetText(data),
  html: this.generatePasswordResetHTML(data),
  // Disable click tracking for security-sensitive password reset emails
  headers: {
    'X-No-Click-Tracking': 'true',
  },
  trackingSettings: {
    clickTracking: {
      enable: false,
      enableText: false,
    },
  },
}
```

**Why this is important:**
- ✅ **Security**: Password reset links should never be tracked
- ✅ **Privacy**: No third-party can see the reset URLs
- ✅ **Direct links**: No redirects through tracking domains
- ✅ **No SSL issues**: Links point directly to your domain

---

### **2. Improved Server URL Detection**

Updated `src/app/api/ecommerce/customers/forgot-password/route.ts` to better detect the server URL:

```typescript
// Get the server URL from various sources
const serverUrl =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL ||
  process.env.VERCEL_URL ||
  (request.headers.get('host')
    ? `${request.headers.get('x-forwarded-proto') || 'http'}://${request.headers.get('host')}`
    : 'http://localhost:3000')
```

This ensures the correct domain is used in:
- ✅ Development (localhost:3000)
- ✅ Production (your actual domain)
- ✅ Vercel deployments (automatic)

---

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### **1. Restart Your Server**

Stop and restart your development server to apply the changes:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
pnpm dev
```

### **2. Request a New Password Reset**

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`
2. Enter your email: `superiorwech@gmail.com`
3. Submit the form

### **3. Check the New Email**

The new password reset email will have:
- ✅ **Direct links** (no SendGrid tracking)
- ✅ **Your actual domain** in the URL
- ✅ **No SSL errors** when clicking

### **4. Click the Reset Link**

You should now be taken directly to:
```
https://afrimall.app/auth/reset-password?token=abc123...
```

Or in development:
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password?token=abc123...
```

**No more redirects through SendGrid domains!** ✅

---

## 📧 Environment Variables

Make sure you have this set in your `.env.local`:

```env
# For development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000

# For production (update before deploying)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://afrimall.app
```

**Important:** Change this to your production URL before deploying!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After restarting your server, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Request password reset
- [ ] Receive email

## 🚨 If You Still See Tracking Links

If you still see SendGrid tracking links after this fix:

### **Option 1: Disable in SendGrid Dashboard**

1. Log in to SendGrid: https://app.sendgrid.com
2. Go to **Settings** → **Tracking**
3. Turn off **Click Tracking**
4. Save changes

### **Option 2: Check Email Client**

Some email clients cache emails. Try:
- Clear email cache
- Request a new password reset
- Check in a different email client

### **Option 3: Wait for SendGrid**

SendGrid settings can take a few minutes to propagate. Wait 5-10 minutes and try again.
