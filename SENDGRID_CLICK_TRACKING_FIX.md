# 🔗 SendGrid Click Tracking Issue - FIX

## 🔍 Problem

When you click the reset password link in the email, you're being redirected to:
```
url5873.afrimall.app
```

This causes an SSL error because:
1. **SendGrid Click Tracking** is enabled
2. SendGrid wraps all links with their tracking domain
3. The tracking domain doesn't have a valid SSL certificate for your domain

## 🎯 Solution Options

### **Option 1: Disable SendGrid Click Tracking (Recommended for Password Reset)**

Password reset emails should **NOT** have click tracking for security reasons anyway.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Log in to SendGrid Dashboard**
   - Go to https://app.sendgrid.com

2. **Disable Click Tracking Globally (Recommended)**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Tracking**
   - Turn off **Click Tracking**
   - Save changes

   OR disable it for specific emails by adding headers to the email code.

3. **Alternative: Disable per Email (Better)**
   
   I'll update the email service to disable click tracking for password reset emails specifically.

### **Option 2: Set Up SendGrid Link Branding (More Work)**

This configures your domain to work with SendGrid's click tracking.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Log in to SendGrid Dashboard**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication** → **Link Branding**
3. Click **Brand a Link**
4. Enter your domain: `afrimall.app`
5. Follow DNS setup instructions
6. Verify the domain

**Note:** This requires DNS changes and domain verification.

## 🔧 Code Fix Applied

I've already updated the forgot-password API to better detect the server URL. Now let me add click tracking disable to the email service.

## 📝 Immediate Workaround

**For testing right now:**

1. **Copy the URL from the email** (don't click it)
2. **Look for the actual reset URL** in the link
3. **Manually replace** `url5873.afrimall.app` with your actual domain
4. Or **paste the URL** and modify it before visiting

**Example:**
```
From: https://url5873.afrimall.app/ls/click?upn=...
To:   https://afrimall.app/auth/reset-password?token=abc123...
```

The token is still in the URL, just hidden by SendGrid's tracking wrapper.
