2. **Test Steps:**
   - Complete checkout
   - Compare order totals with expected values

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Subtotal should match cart subtotal
   - Shipping should be added (currently $9.99)
   - Tax should be calculated (currently 10%)
   - Total should be subtotal + shipping + tax

### Test 4: Variant Data Handling
1. **Setup:**
   - Add products with variants to cart
   - Mix products with and without variants

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Complete checkout process

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Variant ID should be included when applicable
   - Unit price should reflect variant price when applicable
   - Product snapshot should show correct variant information

### Test 5: Empty Cart Prevention
1. **Setup:**
   - Clear cart completely

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Try to proceed through checkout

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Order creation should fail with "Cart is empty" error
   - User should be prevented from completing checkout

### Test 6: Incomplete Address Validation
1. **Setup:**
   - Add items to cart
   - Leave shipping address incomplete

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Try to complete checkout

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Order creation should fail with "Shipping address is incomplete" error
   - User should be prompted to complete address

## API Testing

### Test 7: Order API Data Structure
1. **Create Order:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/orders
   ```

2. **Expected Response Structure:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "id": "order_id",
       "orderNumber": "AFR1234567890",
       "items": [
         {
           "product": "product_id",
           "variant": "variant_id_or_null",
           "quantity": 2,
           "unitPrice": 29.99,
           "totalPrice": 59.98,
           "productSnapshot": {
             "title": "Product Name",
             "sku": "PRODUCT-SKU-001",
             "image": "image_url_or_null"
           }
         }
       ],
       "subtotal": 59.98,
       "total": 75.97,
       "currency": "USD",
       "customer": "customer_id",
       "shipping": { ... },
       "billing": { ... },
       "payment": { ... },
       "status": "confirmed"
     }
   }
   ```

### Test 8: Order Retrieval
1. **Get Order:**
   ```bash
   GET /api/orders/{orderId}
   ```

2. **Expected Results:**
   - Order should be retrieved with all populated data
   - Items should have complete product information
   - All addresses and payment info should be present

## Edge Cases

### Test 9: Large Cart Handling
1. **Setup:**
   - Add many items to cart (10+ items)
   - Mix different products and variants

2. **Test Steps:**
   - Complete checkout process

3. **Expected Results:**
   - All items should be included in order
   - Totals should be calculated correctly
   - No data should be lost

### Test 10: Concurrent Order Creation
1. **Setup:**
   - Open multiple browser tabs with same cart
   - Complete checkout in multiple tabs simultaneously

2. **Expected Results:**
   - Only one order should be created successfully
   - Cart should be cleared after successful order
   - Duplicate orders should be prevented

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… **What's Fixed:**
1. **Cart Data Population** - Cart items are properly mapped to order items
2. **SKU Field** - Product SKU is now included in cart and order data
3. **Data Validation** - Added validation for empty cart and incomplete addresses
4. **Order Totals** - Totals are calculated from actual cart data
5. **Product Snapshots** - Complete product information is preserved in orders
6. **Error Handling** - Better error messages for data validation failures
7. **Logging** - Added console logging for debugging order creation

### ðŸ”§ **Key Improvements:**
- **Complete Data Mapping** - All cart data is properly transferred to orders
- **SKU Integration** - Product SKUs are now available in orders
- **Validation** - Prevents orders with incomplete data
- **Type Safety** - Updated TypeScript interfaces for better type checking
- **Debugging** - Added logging to track order creation process

### ðŸ“Š **Data Flow:**
1. Cart items â†’ Order items with complete product data
2. Cart subtotal â†’ Order subtotal
3. Calculated totals (subtotal + shipping + tax) â†’ Order total
4. Customer data â†’ Order customer relationship
5. Address data â†’ Order shipping/billing information
