# 📧 Email Not Sending - FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The issue was that **Payload CMS was not configured to use your SMTP email service**. The logs showed:

```
[20:45:54] WARN: No email adapter provided. Email will be written to console.
[20:46:02] INFO: Email attempted without being configured.
```

Even though your SMTP credentials were correct (SendGrid), Payload CMS needs its own email adapter configured to actually send emails.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've configured Payload CMS to use the nodemailer adapter with your SMTP settings:

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/payload.config.ts`**
   - Added `@payloadcms/email-nodemailer` import
   - Added email configuration using your SMTP environment variables

2. **`package.json`**
   - Added `@payloadcms/email-nodemailer` dependency

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install the New Dependency

Run this command to install the email adapter:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or if using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Restart Your Development Server

Stop your current server (Ctrl+C) and restart it:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Test the Password Recovery Flow

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password`

1. Enter your email: `superiorwech@gmail.com`
2. Submit the form
3. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
4. You should receive the password reset email! ✅

## 📧 What Changed in the Configuration

### Before:
```typescript
// No email configuration
export default buildConfig({
  // ... other config
})
```

### After:
```typescript
import { nodemailerAdapter } from '@payloadcms/email-nodemailer'

export default buildConfig({
  // ... other config
  email: process.env.SMTP_HOST
    ? nodemailerAdapter({
        defaultFromAddress: process.env.SMTP_FROM || 'noreply@afrimall.app',
        defaultFromName: 'AfriMall',
        transportOptions: {
          host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
          port: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || '587'),
          secure: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || '587') === 465,
          auth: {
            user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
            pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,
          },
        },
      })
    : undefined,
})
```

This configuration:
- Uses your existing SMTP environment variables
- Automatically configures SendGrid (or any SMTP provider)
- Enables Payload's `forgotPassword` method to actually send emails
- Falls back gracefully if SMTP is not configured

---

## 🔍 Verification

After restarting, you should see in your server logs:

```
✅ Email service initialized successfully
✅ No warning about "Email will be written to console"
✅ Password reset email sent successfully
```

And you should **receive the actual email** in your inbox!

---

## 📧 Your Current SMTP Configuration

Based on your logs, you're using **SendGrid**:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASS=[your SendGrid API key]
SMTP_FROM=orders@afrimall.app
```

This is correctly configured! ✅

## 🐛 If You Still Don't Receive Emails

### 1. Check SendGrid Dashboard
- Log in to https://sendgrid.com
- Check "Activity" to see if emails are being sent
- Verify your sender email `orders@afrimall.app` is verified
- Check for any sending limits or restrictions

### 2. Verify Email Authentication
SendGrid requires sender verification. Make sure:
- Your domain `afrimall.app` is verified in SendGrid
- Or your sender email `orders@afrimall.app` is verified

### 3. Check Spam Folder
SendGrid emails sometimes go to spam initially until your domain builds reputation.

### 4. Test SendGrid Connection
```bash
# Test email service
npx tsx src/scripts/test-email.ts
```

### 5. Check API Key Permissions
Make sure your SendGrid API key has "Mail Send" permissions.
