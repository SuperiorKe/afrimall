# How to Recover Failed Payments

## Problem

You were charged by your bank, but:
- No order was created in Afrimall
- No order confirmation email was received
- Money was deducted from your account

## Why This Happened

This occurred because of a bug in the old payment flow where:
1. Payment succeeded in Stripe ✅
2. Order was only created AFTER payment ✅
3. The order creation step failed ❌
4. Money was already charged ❌

**This bug is now fixed** - new orders are created BEFORE payment, so this won't happen again.

## How to Get Your Money Back

### **Option 1: Contact Stripe Support (Recommended)**

Since the payment went through Stripe, you need to process the refund through Stripe:

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com
   - Log in with your Stripe account

2. **Find Your Payment**
   - Click on "Payments" in the left sidebar
   - Search for payments from the time period when you attempted the purchase
   - Look for payments with amount $0.60 (or the amount you were charged)
   - Check the customer email field if you see your email

3. **Identify the Payment Intent**
   - Look for payment intents that show "succeeded" status
   - Check the creation date/time to match your transaction

4. **Process the Refund**
   - Click on the payment intent
   - Click "Refund payment"
   - Select "Full refund"
   - Add a note: "Customer charged but no order created due to system error"
   - Confirm the refund

### **Option 2: Manual Order Creation + Refund**

If you can't access Stripe directly, you can ask the Afrimall admin to:

1. **Find the payment in Stripe**
   - Search Stripe dashboard for your email or payment amount
   - Look for payment intents from the date of your transaction

2. **Create a manual order for reconciliation**
   - Admin can create an order record for the failed transaction
   - Link it to the Stripe payment intent

3. **Process full refund**
   - Admin uses the order system to refund the amount
   - Or processes refund directly through Stripe

### **Option 3: Contact Your Bank**

If the above options don't work:

1. **File a Dispute**
   - Contact your bank about the unauthorized charge
   - Provide:
     - Date of transaction
     - Amount charged
     - Receipt (bank statement)
     - Explain: "Payment processed but no goods received"

2. **Bank Investigation**
   - Your bank will investigate
   - They may reverse the charge temporarily
   - Contact Afrimall through the bank's dispute process

## What Information to Gather

Before contacting support, gather this information:

- **Date and Time**: When did you attempt the purchase?
- **Amount**: How much were you charged? ($0.60 based on your logs)
- **Email**: What email did you use? (`superiorwech@gmail.com` from your logs)
- **Payment Method**: Credit card or debit card?
- **Browser**: What browser were you using?
- **Screenshot**: If you have a screenshot of the error message

## Preventing This in the Future

✅ **The bug has been fixed!**

New payment flow:
1. Order is created FIRST (in pending status)
2. Payment is processed
3. Order is updated on success

**This ensures:**
- Your money is not lost
- Orders are always created
- Easy refund if payment fails
